Revision history for OpenERP-OOM

        Fixed fallback order when parsing dates and timestamps read from Odoo

0.14    Fri Sept 21, 2012
        Finally started to make sure we send the context information 
        relating to translation, specifically we send lang: en_GB in the
        context whenever we do a read to ensure the data is translated.

        The language sent is configurable on the schema object and is simply
        named lang.

        # FIXME: this might be a bad idea if we aren't doing it on writes too.

0.13    Sept 11, 2012 
        (internal release)
        Added new method named search_limited_fieldsfor doing searches.
        It avoids pulling down the data for every field when constructing 
        the objects after finding their ids.

        Removed some old debug references to Data::Dumper.
